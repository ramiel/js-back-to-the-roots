# Redux Todos - Naked

The aim of this project is to see how all the new technologies will work and how them are written as if there is no preprocessor, like if the only available tools are vanilla javascript and the browser.
The code cames from the redux example "[todos](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todos)"
